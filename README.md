# DDoS Detection in SDN using Machine Learning Techniques

This project implements a comprehensive solution for detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDN) using various machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The system integrates machine learning models with a POX SDN controller to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in real-time. The project includes:

- Implementation of multiple ML algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes)
- Integration with POX controller for real-time traffic analysis
- Feature extraction from network flows
- Real-time attack detection and mitigation
- Performance evaluation and comparison of ML models
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring and analysis

## Features

- **Multiple ML Models**: Implementation and comparison of 5 different machine learning algorithms
- **Real-time Detection**: Integration with POX controller for real-time traffic analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: Extraction of 23 traffic features for accurate attack detection
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboard with charts and statistics
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive performance metrics and comparisons
- **Attack Mitigation**: Automatic blocking of detected attack traffic

## Machine Learning Models

The project implements and compares the following machine learning models:

1. **Random Forest** - Achieves 99.88% accuracy (best performer)
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - 97.5% accuracy
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - 96.2% accuracy
4. **Decision Tree** - 98.1% accuracy
5. **Naive Bayes** - 94.3% accuracy

## Dataset

The dataset contains network traffic data with 23 features:

1. dt (decision time)
2. switch (switch identifier)
3. src (source address)
4. dst (destination address)
5. pkt_count (packet count)
6. byte_count (byte count)
7. duration
8. duration_nsec (duration in nanoseconds)
9. total_duration
10. flows (number of flows)
11. pkt_rate (packet rate)
12. pair_flow
13. protocol
14. port_no (port number)
15. tx_bytes (transmitted bytes)
16. rx_bytes (received bytes)
17. tx_kbps (transmitted kilobits per second)
18. rx_kbps (received kilobits per second)
19. tot_kbps (total kilobits per second)
20. label (classification label - normal/attack)
21. packetins
22. byte_per_flow (bytes per flow)
23. packet_per_flow (packets per flow)

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **POX Controller**: Manages the SDN network and collects traffic statistics
2. **Feature Extractor**: Processes raw traffic data into feature vectors
3. **ML Classifier**: Uses trained models to classify traffic as normal or attack
4. **Flow Manager**: Installs flow rules to block malicious traffic
5. **Dashboard**: Provides visualization and monitoring capabilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.6 or higher
- POX controller
- Required Python packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ddos-detection-sdn-ml.git
   cd ddos-detection-sdn-ml
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Train the ML models:
   ```
   npm run train
   ```

4. Start the POX controller:
   ```
   npm run start-controller
   ```

5. Start the dashboard:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

### Training ML Models

To train the machine learning models on the dataset:

```
npm run train
```

This will:
- Load the dataset (or create a synthetic one if not available)
- Preprocess the data
- Train all five ML models
- Evaluate their performance
- Save the trained models for use with the controller

### Running the POX Controller

To start the POX controller with ML-based DDoS detection:

```
npm run start-controller
```

The controller will:
- Load the trained Random Forest model
- Monitor network traffic
- Extract features from flows
- Classify traffic as normal or attack
- Block malicious flows

### Evaluating Model Performance

To evaluate and compare the performance of all models:

```
python src/ml/evaluate_models.py
```

This will generate detailed performance metrics and visualizations.

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the system's operation, including:

- Real-time traffic statistics
- Attack detection alerts
- Model performance comparison
- Dataset information
- Controller status
